# Stellarium Web frontend

This directory contains the Graphical User Interface for using
Stellarium Web Engine in a web page.

This is a Vuejs project, which can generate a fully static webpage with webpack.

Official page: [stellarium-web.org](https://stellarium-web.org)

## Build setup using Docker
Make sure docker is installed, then:

``` bash
# generate the docker image
make setup

# and run the development version (go to http://localhost:8080 on your machine)
make dev

# Optionally, compile a production version of the site with minification
make build

# and finally to host it on a test server (http://localhost:8000)
make start
```

## Build Setup without Docker

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build
```
